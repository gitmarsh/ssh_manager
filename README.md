# ssh_manager
A simple tool for managing mutliple ssh connections

"mkdir ./server_aliases"
Make a directory called "server_aliases" in the same directory as the script in order to save aliases for later use.

"alias sshmanager='sh /path/to/this/remote-aliases'"
Optionally add an alias to your .bashrc (or equivalent) that points to this script to make it running the tool easier.
