# ssh_manager
A simple tool for managing mutliple ssh connections

Make a directory called "server_aliases" in the same directory as the script in order to save aliases for later use.
" mkdir ./server_aliases "
Optionally add an aliases to your .bashrc (or equivalent) that points to this script to make it running the tool easier.
